# Model-Based-Decision-Making
        The purpose of this research paper is to highlight how a company uses Business Intelligence (BI) for its business decisions. According to Mulcahy (2007), organizations use business intelligence to support their business decision processes. Business intelligence helps companies analyze data to decide optimal business decisions, identify new business opportunities, cut costs, and improve business decisions. Specifically, I am going to analyze Ruth’s Chris business decision, which is to decide international expansion of company. Dan Hannah, vice president for business development at Ruth’s Chris, is trying to deal with international expansion. Based on possible alternative countries, Hannah will decide to expand. In order to show the benefits of business intelligence in decision-making, I am going to use the technique called “decision matrix,” which is one types of the “Model Based Decision Making” to find the optimal business decision. I will discuss different scenarios depending on given data and predict what could happen if Hannah chose to expand that country. I have 33 different countries with their per capita beef consumption, population, urbanization, per capita GDP, meat consumption growth rate. Also, I am going to use this data to create charts to help me with model based simulation technique. Ultimately, I am likely to find the optimal business decision for expansion.
